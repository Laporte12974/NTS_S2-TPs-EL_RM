Everywhere At The End Of Time - The Caretaker

#Application:
A partial reimplementation of the game "Face Raiders" for the Nintendo 3DS System.
We used the face of our classmate, Corentin SCHIEBEL, as a model for our basic enemy's face, and models from the game extracted by the person mentioned above.
We used the Mono backend for scripting, as it is the default backed for scripting in Unity.

Our game's goal is to destroy the enemies as they spawn, one by one. The objective is to kill as many enemies given the alotted time.
The player is able to restart a game or quit it once the alotted time is over. The score is reset on each game.

If the player reaches over 50 points at the end of the timer, he wins and is rewarded by a victory screen. However, should he fail to reach the objective, he will lose the game and be thrown at the restart screen.
